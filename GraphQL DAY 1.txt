EXPLANATION

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open-source project in 2015.

*GraphQL has its own syntax to query and manipulate data. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, and nothing more

*GraphQL APIs are defined by a schema, which specifies the types of data that can be queried and the relationships between them

*Queries are used to read or fetch data from the server, while mutations are used to modify data on the server

*Unlike traditional REST APIs that often have multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint. Clients can request the specific data they need by structuring their queries accordingly.


Apollo Server Express is the use of Apollo Server with an Express.js-based backend. It integrates Apollo Server's ability to manage GraphQL queries with the flexibility and power of Express.js as a server framework.
