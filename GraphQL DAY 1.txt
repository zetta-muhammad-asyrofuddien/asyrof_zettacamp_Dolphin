EXPLANATION

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open-source project in 2015.

*GraphQL has its own syntax to query and manipulate data. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, and nothing more

*GraphQL APIs are defined by a schema, which specifies the types of data that can be queried and the relationships between them

*Queries are used to read or fetch data from the server, while mutations are used to modify data on the server

*Unlike traditional REST APIs that often have multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint. Clients can request the specific data they need by structuring their queries accordingly.


Apollo Server is a platform that allows you to easily build and run GraphQL APIs. Apollo Server can be used with various backend technologies, one of the tecnologi is Express.js.
Apollo Server is an implementation of the GraphQL specification. It allows you to define GraphQL schemas (including types, operations, and resolvers) as well as provide GraphQL-based API services.
